To set up an AWS Lambda function that triggers Elastic Transcoder for video processing, you will need to go through several steps, including creating an S3 bucket, setting up Elastic Transcoder, creating a Lambda function, and configuring the necessary permissions. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

1. **Go to the S3 Console:**
   - Click on "Create bucket."
   - Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., `my-video-input-bucket`).
   - Choose a region and configure other settings as desired.
   - Click "Create bucket."

2. **Create an Output Bucket:**
   - Create another bucket for the transcoded output (e.g., `my-video-output-bucket`).

### Step 2: Create an IAM Role for Lambda

1. **Go to the IAM Console:**
   - Click on "Roles" and then "Create role."
   - Choose "AWS service" and select "Lambda."

2. **Attach Policies:**
   - Attach the following managed policies:
     - **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole**: Grants CloudWatch logging permissions.
     - **S3 Access Policy**: Create a custom policy to allow Lambda to access both S3 buckets.

3. **Create a Custom Policy:**
   Use the policy below, modifying it for your bucket names:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject",
                   "s3:PutObject",
                   "s3:ListBucket"
               ],
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::my-video-input-bucket",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::my-video-input-bucket/*",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::my-video-output-bucket",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::my-video-output-bucket/*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "elastictranscoder:*",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Create the Role:**
   - Give the role a name (e.g., `LambdaElasticTranscoderRole`) and create it.

### Step 3: Set Up Elastic Transcoder

1. **Go to the Elastic Transcoder Console:**
   - Click on "Pipelines" and then "Create new pipeline."
   - Enter a name for the pipeline.
   - Choose the input and output S3 buckets you created earlier.
   - Choose an IAM role for Elastic Transcoder (you can create a new role or use an existing one).
   - Click "Create pipeline."

2. **Create Presets:**
   - Create a new preset for the format you want to transcode to (e.g., MP4, HLS).
   - Use the existing presets or customize them as needed.

### Step 4: Create Your Lambda Function

1. **Go to the Lambda Console:**
   - Click "Create function."
   - Choose "Author from scratch."
   - Give it a name (e.g., `TranscodeVideoFunction`) and choose the runtime (e.g., Python).

2. **Add Code to Trigger Elastic Transcoder:**
   Here’s an example Python code to handle the S3 trigger and start the Elastic Transcoder job:

   ```python
   import json
   import boto3

   elastictranscoder = boto3.client('elastictranscoder')
   input_bucket = 'my-video-input-bucket'
   output_bucket = 'my-video-output-bucket'
   pipeline_id = 'your-pipeline-id'  # Replace with your pipeline ID
   preset_id = 'your-preset-id'        # Replace with your preset ID

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Get the uploaded file information
       bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
       key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

       # Create the Elastic Transcoder job
       response = elastictranscoder.create_job(
           PipelineId=pipeline_id,
           Input={
               'Key': key,
               'Container': 'mp4'  # Adjust based on your input format
           },
           Output={
               'Key': f'transcoded-{key}',
               'PresetId': preset_id
           }
       )

       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps('Transcoding job created!')
       }
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up S3 Trigger for Lambda

1. **Go back to your Lambda function:**
   - Click on "Configuration" > "Triggers."
   - Click "Add trigger" and choose S3.
   - Select your input bucket and configure the event type (e.g., "All object create events").
   - Click "Add."

### Step 6: Deploy and Test

1. **Upload a Video to the Input Bucket:**
   - Go to your input S3 bucket and upload a video file.

2. **Check CloudWatch Logs:**
   - Go to the CloudWatch console to monitor logs for your Lambda function and see if the Elastic Transcoder job is triggered successfully.

3. **Verify Transcoded Output:**
   - Check your output S3 bucket for the transcoded video file.

### Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Add error handling in your Lambda function to manage failures in job creation or S3 operations.
- **Monitoring:** Use CloudWatch metrics and alarms to monitor the Lambda function and Elastic Transcoder jobs.
- **Testing Presets:** Ensure your presets are correctly configured for the input formats you're working with.
